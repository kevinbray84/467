In your eyes, the two pieces that seem to stand out in the room are the couch and the billiards table. While taking stock of the room, you make note that the northern french doors lead to the Veranda, the dark stairs to the east seem to lead to the Basement, through the door to the west is the Master Suite, and the open sliding partition to the south leads to the Dining Room.",

You decide to check the pockets of the jacket for clues. Nothing to be found in the outer pockets besides lint, but wait, what's this? In the breast pocket you find a slip of paper with a series of three numbers hand written on it. Very interesting...this piece of paper could be useful later.",

This table is closer to a work of art than a playing surface. You are half temped to rack'em up, but quickly realize how poor of an idea that is. Someone's life is on the line, this is no time for games."
