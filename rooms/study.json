No need to impress in this room. Looking around, you see a computer and a stack of mail on a desk. Might be some clues somewhere in this room. The only exit from the study seems to be the door you came in through. The door is on the western wall and leads back out into the Second Floor Foyer.",

The most interesting files are those you found in an email that seems to be a contracting bill for some extentive remodeling that has been done somewhere in the basement area. It seems like they added an additional room...interesting."
