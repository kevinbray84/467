    "long description": "You step outside into the Veranda. The air is humid and the sky is dark on this July evening. It seems like a summer storm is setting in. Along with the sky, you notice a patio table situated in the center of the Veranda with a perfect view of the stormy weather.  On the southern wall is a door leading back into the Family Room. The door on the eastern wall leads back indoors as well, opening into the Grand Room. ",

   "look at": {
        "patio table":"You approach the patio table and notice a half finished bottle of wine on the table. Looking under the bottle you notice a folded piece of paper. Moving the bottle, you take a better look at the paper and see that it is a receipt for an astonishingly large wine order. Your jaw drops at the amount of wine ordered and the size of the bill. Just how can they afford all this extravagance?",
        "sky":"Your gaze trends upwards into the clouds as you take a close look at the storm brewing overhead. Suddenly the sky is filled with a flash of lightning and the roar of thunder.The lightning bolt seemed to strike uncomfortably close and you cannot help but feel a sense of foreboding from this storm."
