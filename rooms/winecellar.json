You also notice that the temperature decreased when you stepped into this room. It must be climate controlled you think to yourself. Looking around the room, other than the various wine racks the only noticeable feature is a bare wall. Will they continue to expand their collection until the entire room is completely filled? The only exit seems to be the glass door to the north that leads back into the Basement.",
