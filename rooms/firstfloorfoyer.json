    "long description": "You are standing in the Foyer of the mansion. The interior seems to sparkle, and you marvel at the grandeur of the entrance with its marble floors and dark mahogany woodwork. In front of you, to the north, is a grand staircase leading to the second floor. Peering into the room to the west, you see books that line the walls from the floor to the ceiling. You make a mental note that this is the location of the library. To the east you can see what appears to be the dining room with an elongated table adorned with expensive china and fancy glassware. In the Foyer, next to the door you see a stack of mail and on the wall hang a set of keys.",
