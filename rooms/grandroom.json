    "long description": "The Grand Room truly lived up to its name. The room was massive in size and you could easily envision holding high society parties and concerts within this room. On the western wall was a magnificent fireplace.  Above the fireplace is a large family portrait. To the east was a set of double doors that lead outside to the Veranda. To the south was the door toward the Master Suite.",

        "fireplace":"You step over to the fireplace, marveling at the intricate craftsmanship. Looking in the fire pit you are surprised to see a fair amount of ashes built up. You did not expect this family to be using the fireplace in July. Something does not add up. You sift the ashes with your finger and come across the remnants of a burnt letter. Just the corner is left, but the portion of the letter you can make out looks remarkably like the note the supposed kidnappers left. ",
        "family portrait":"Gazing at the family portrait, you look at the figure of a young Sarah. She should be roughly 10 when this was made you guess. You ponder if she has any inclination as to what fate had in store for her?"
