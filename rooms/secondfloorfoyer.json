Taking in the view of the room, the only notable feature seems to be the table with drawers positioned against the wall. Behind you is the southern staircase that leads back down to the First Floor Foyer. To the west is a door littered with hand drawn pictures attached to its surface. That must be the Sarahâ€™s Room. To the east is you see a Study.",

Glancing at the front page you read the headline Day 4: Kidnapping investigation still underway. Has it really only been 4 days you think to yourself. You were proud at first to have been detailed to the investigation team but quickly found the couple to be surprisingly uncooperative when trying to question them. Your superiors said they must just be in shock, but when you continued to press them suddenly you found yourself stuck on desk duty doing grunt work. You have always relied on your instincts and they were now screaming at you that something didnt add up in this case. Snapping out of your thoughts, you further resolve yourself to get to the bottom of this case. ",
